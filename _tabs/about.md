Hi, this is my personal blog to register any future projects I might work on. I'm an electrical engineer with BSc from UFPR (Brazil) and masters in electronic systems from the University of Bordeaux (as well as an engineering degree from ENSEIRB-MATMECA with focus in Telecommunication Sytems). I'm currently pursuing my PhD at Eindhoven University of Technology. You can call me Gui, which is short for Guilherme. I'll be trying to build some electronic circuits, some software and maybe even some 3-D printed stuff. I'll try to keep as opensource as possible but I might jump into more professional software (and compare to opensource) if I ever decide to play with RF at home. I don't use much twitter, but I guess I'll be trying to from now on. 

I'm also a Celtics fan, so we can talk about that maybe.
