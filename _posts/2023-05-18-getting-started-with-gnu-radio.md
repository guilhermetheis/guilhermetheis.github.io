# Installation & Setups

I'm installing my GNU Radio using [radioconda](https://github.com/ryanvolz/radioconda), this was recommended to me in the [Matrix community of GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/community/). Most of the setups can be checked there. 

# Learning

I'll start first by going through [PySDR](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html), then I'll add in some sprinkles of Analog Devices [Software-Defined Radio for Engineers](https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html). Theory will be presented in the post [Re-learning DSP](https://guilhermetheis.github.io/posts/re-learning-dsp/) of ths website.
