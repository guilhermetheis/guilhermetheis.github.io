# Why re-learn DSP

Its been a few years since I last really worked with DSP and SDRs effectively, since I graduated in my masters. While I still remember the basic concepts (specially because I'm currently working with antenna and 5G hardware), how a few things are implemented and calculated need to be re-visited so I can properly build flow-charts in GNURadio for instance. I'll be mostly using [PySDR](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html) but any other resource will evidently be added here. I will be following the flow from the website and taking notes on it.

# Important reminders

Chapters 1-3 talk about very usual stuff I work it from FDomain to sampling. These are all things I'm quite used so I'm not writing them down, though I'm carefully reading it.
