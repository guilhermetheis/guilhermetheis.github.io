      I did a small python script to retrieve this data. I’ll probably do a better job and round up a better analysis later on when I can fully work on it. I’ll probably do some sort of blog post about it so you can always check my twitter to see. I do warn you I mostly talk Celtics there.

      Assumptions


  The Celtics are pushing for more double-big lineups
  Both Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser need to improve
  Robert Williams needs to be somewhat healthy
  Kristaps Porziņģis needs to be healthy


Data sample

The data used is going to be all from Basketball Reference, Basketball Index, 538, DARKO since these are the free-to-use websites available.

      Why re-learn DSP

Its been a few years since I last really worked with DSP and SDRs effectively, since I graduated in my masters. While I still remember the basic concepts (specially because I’m currently working with antenna and 5G hardware), how a few things are implemented and calculated need to be re-visited so I can properly build flow-charts in GNURadio for instance. I’ll be mostly using ...

      Installation &amp;amp; Setups

I’m installing my GNU Radio using radioconda, this was recommended to me in the Matrix community of GNURadio. Most of the setups can be checked there.

Learning

I’ll start first by going through PySDR, then I’ll add in some sprinkles of Analog Devices Software-Defined Radio for Engineers. Theory will be presented in the post Re-learning DSP of ths website.

      This is, hopefully, an in-depth (ELI5) post on how I designed the script. We will use the github repository README as a starting point.

Installation and usage

The premise of the code is to use a combination of pandas and praw to get firstly markdown formatted tables from ESPN and then finally to paste those files into reddit. Then github actions to deploy the code every day, scheduled at give...
